# iOS-Portfolio
On January 1, 2016, I began an [iOS 10 and Swift 3 course](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10/). This is a collection of all code I completed as a part of this course. This course has 20 sections and one optional section. At the top of this README is the last date the repository was modified, and the current section I am working on is written as well. Below is a table describing:

1. All the sections.
2. Whether or not the section is incomplete, in-progress, or complete (i.e., I have yet to follow, am following, or followed along with all the videos in that section, and have yet to write, am writing, or wrote a fully-functioning app).
3. Whether or not the code has been documented (has comments, a README, etc.).

Each section has a corresponding directory, each of which containing the source code of the projects that I created while developing the applications that were taught in the videos for that section. Each project has or will have a README. When that section's `Commented?` column states `Yes` in the table below, that means that, not only is that sections' code commented, but it also means that all the aforementioned READMEs can be found in that section's directory.
