# iOS-Portfolio
On January 1, 2017, I began an [iOS 10 and Swift 3 course](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10/). This is a collection of all code I completed as a part of this course. This course has 20 sections and one optional section, and my current progress in the course is written at the top of this README and in the table below, with the number of items completed and the section of the course I am currently on at the top, and a section-by-section breakdown in the table.

In the table, all the sections are listed in the first two columns, and that section's status is listed in the third column. The status can either be:

1. `Incomplete`, meaning no progress has been made whatsoever in this section yet,
2. `In-Progress`, meaning I am currently working on this section of the course, or
3. `Complete`, meaning I have completed this section of this course.

_However_, having a status of `Complete` does not mean that the code for that section is commented. Instead, it means that I have a fully-functioning version of the app(s) that was taught in that section of the course. If the rightmost column states `Yes`, then that means the code for the app(s) in that section has been commented, which includes a README. If it is `No`, then the code has not been documented.

Each section has a corresponding directory, and each contains the source code for the app(s) covered in that section.
