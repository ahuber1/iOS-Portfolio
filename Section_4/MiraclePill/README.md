# Important Notes with the Miracle Pill App

In this app, there is a `UIPickerView` that displays all the states in the United States, and its abbreviation (e.g., `CA (California)`). This information is stored in [`MiraclePill/states.txt`](https://github.com/ahuber1/iOS-Portfolio/blob/master/Section_4/MiraclePill/MiraclePill/states.txt), and is read by the app in order to generate the list of items displayed in the `UIPickerView`. **REMOVING `states.txt` WILL CAUSE THE APP TO CRASH!!!**
