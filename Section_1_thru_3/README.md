# Section 1 through 3

This directory contains the code that was written during Sections 1 through 3 of the [iOS 10 and Swift 3 course](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10/) I am currently taking. There is no code for Sections 1 and 3 as is explained below, but there is code for Section 2.

## Section 1
**Getting Started with iOS 10 & Swift**

Section 1 was primarily an introduction to the course, which means that there was no code to write.

## Section 2
**Learn to Code with Swift 3**

Section 2 was introducing the students to Swift. I already had a little experience in the past with Swift, but I did a personal project in order to utilize the vast majority of the fundamental features in Swift; that personal project is found in the `SwiftMazeSearch` directory. The `Numbers`, `StringOutStrungOut`, and `Variables` directories contain code for playgrounds that I did along with the course in Xcode. However, no additional documentation exists in these directories because the code is from simple exercises, and the code is self-explanatory.

- The `Numbers` directory contains code that I wrote when learning about numbers (`Int`s, `Double`s, etc.) in Swift.
- The `StringOutStrungOut` directory contains code that I wrote when learning about `String`s in Swift.
- The `Variables` directory contains code that I wrote when learning about variables in Swift.

## Section 3
**Version Control with Git & GitHub**

Section 3 was an introduction to Git and GitHub, but thanks to my university studies, I already had a lot of experience with Git and GitHub. I learned how to better use Git's command-line tool, but other than that, Section 3 did not teach me anything new, which is why there is no code relating to Git and GitHub.The two main things I did learn, however, was how to better understand the output from the `git status` command, and the `git add -A` command.
