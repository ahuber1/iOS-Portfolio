# Section 1 through 3

This directory contains the code that was written during Sections 1 through 3. There is no code for Sections 1 and 3 as is explained below, but there is code for Section 2.

## Section 1
**Getting Started with iOS 10 & Swift**

Section 1 was primarily an introduction to the course, which means that there was no code to write.

## Section 2
**Learn to Code with Swift 3**

Section 2 was introducing the students to Swift. I have had a little experience in the past with Swift, and I did a personal project in order to utilize the vast majority of the fundamental features in Swift; that personal project is found in the `SwiftMazeSearch` directory. The `Numbers`, `StringOutStrungOut`, and `Variables` directories contain code that I did along with the course in this section, but because the code in these directories were from simple exercises and the code is self-explanatory, no additional documentation exists.

## Section 3
**Version Control with Git & GitHub**

Section 3 was an introduction to Git and GitHub, but thanks to my university studies, I already had a lot of experience with Git and GitHub. I learned how to better use Git's command-line tool, but other than that, Section 3 did not teach me anything new, which is why there is no code relating to Git and GitHub.
