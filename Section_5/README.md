# Section 5

**Data Persistence & Core Data**

This directory contains code that was completed during Section 4 of the course, which is on "Data Persistence & Core Data". In this directory there is only one subdirectory containing the project that I worked on during the entire duration of this section of the course, that directory being `DreamLister`. The Dream Lister app works in a similar fashion as "Wish Lists" on Amazon, iTunes, and other online stores.
